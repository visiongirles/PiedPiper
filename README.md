# PIED PIPER

The demo of how I used HTML & CSS skills to create adaptive design of this [Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/BL7wdCOSIxYFu1uxctuVzg/%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-Pied-Piper?node-id=0%3A1)

## Design requirements

- Header is fixed and isn't moved if scrolling
- Content is centered and its max-width is 1219px
- Header menu has navigation to the approprite topic (link anchors)
- Minimize the usage of fixed height. Fixed width is required for inner container (refer to second design template in Figma)
- Usage of 'position' is allowed only for header
